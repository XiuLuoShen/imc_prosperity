# The Python code below is the minimum code that is required in a submission file:
# 1. The "datamodel" imports at the top. Using the typing library is optional.
# 2. A class called "Trader", this class name should not be changed.
# 3. A run function that takes a tradingstate as input and outputs a "result" dict.
